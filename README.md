Collatz Conjecture - C++
If you start with any number greater than 1, it will eventually reach 1 using
the following formula:
If even: Divide by two.
If odd: Multiply by three, then add one.
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate that principle, and to count the
number of iterations any given number must go through in order to reach 0.
